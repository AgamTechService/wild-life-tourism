<h6>--Wake up call and Hi-Tea before leaving for early morning game drive.<br/><br/>
--Start your first wildlife safari in one of the best wildlife destinations in India for an enthralling tiger sighting experience. The park is adorned with thickets of teak & bamboo, a magical landscape of rugged cliffs, marshlands, and lakes which make it a happy home for a wide range of animals like tigers, panthers, hyenas, sloth bears, wild dogs, jackals, barking deer, bison, sambar etc.<br/><br/>
--Packed breakfast, served in the forest during the break.<br/><br/>
--After the game drive, spend the rest of your day relaxing in the comfort of the resort.<br/><br/>
--In the afternoon, after lunch, another Game Drive is planned in Buffer Area in Tadoba. There lies BHADRA’s little secret, while there are 55-60 tigers inside the protected reserve, there are over 80 of them, including relaxed tigresses with cubs—outside the park. Today, from the point of game viewing, this might be India’s most productive buffer forest.<br/><br/>
--Afternoon safari last for 3 hrs approx.<br/><br/>
--Hi-Tea after returning from afternoon safari followed by Dinner.</h6></div>
