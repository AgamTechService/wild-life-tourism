            <h2 className="text">Welcome to MUDUMALAI TIGER RESERVE PARK!</h2>
            <div className="explore-details"><h4>Mudumalai Tiger Reserve is located in the Nilgiris District of Tamil Nadu state spread over 688.59 sq.km. at the tri-junction of three states, viz, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu and it plays an unique role by forming part of the Nilgiris Biosphere Reserve, the first Biosphere Reserve in India, declared during 1986. It has a common boundary with Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (Kerala) on the West, Bandipur Tiger Reserve (Karnataka) on the North, and the Nilgiris Division on the South and East and Gudalur Forest Division on the South West, together forming a large conservation landscape for flagship species such as Tiger and Asian Elephant. Reception Centre is located at Theppakadu. <br/>The name Mudumalai means ” the ancient hill range”. Indeed, it is as old as 65 million years when Western Ghats were formed.<br/>
            <br/> Mudumalai Tiger Reserve is about 240 Km from Bangalore, about 90 Km from Mysore, about 68 Km from Udhagamandalam (Ooty) and about 124 Km from Calicut by road. The reserve straddles the Ooty - Mysore interstate national highway (NH 181), roughly midway between the two cities and thus could be approached with equal facility either way.<br/> From Ooty, another approach is through extremely steep ghat road via Kalhatti having 36 hair-pin bends on a narrow road, but with a truncated distance of approximately 40 Km. The nearest railway stations to Mudumalai are Mysore, about 100 Km and Udhagamandalam about 68 Km by Hill track. <br/>The nearest airports are Mysore (90 Km), Calicut (124 km), Coimbatore (160 Km) and Bangalore (240 Km).<br/> The nearest town for medical facility, petrol bunks and with telephone networks are Masinagudi (7 Km) and Gudalur (18 Km). <br/>The nearest township from Karnataka is Gundalpet, about 32 Km from Mudumalai Tiger Reserve.
